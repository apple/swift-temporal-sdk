/// A client that manages connections and communication with a Temporal cluster.
///
/// ``TemporalClient`` provides the primary interface for interacting with Temporal's workflow orchestration platform.
/// It automatically handles retries with endpoint-specific configurations, including maximum timeouts and backoff strategies.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The client encapsulates three main service interfaces:
/// - ``workflowService`` for workflow lifecycle operations
/// - ``namespaceService`` for namespace management
/// - ``operatorService`` for cluster administration
///
/// ## Creating a client
///
/// Use the ``connect(transport:configuration:logger:_:)`` method for a lifetime-scoped client:
///
/// ```swift
/// let configuration = TemporalClient.Configuration(
///     target: .dns(host: "localhost", port: 7233),
///     namespace: "default"
/// )
///
/// try await TemporalClient.connect(
///     transport: HTTP2ClientTransport.Posix(
///         target: configuration.target,
///         transportSecurity: .plaintext
///     ),
///     configuration: configuration
/// ) { client in
///     // Use the client
///     return try await client.startWorkflow(...)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Retry Behavior
///
/// The client automatically retries failed requests based on gRPC status codes and configured retry policies.
/// Each service operation has specific retry configurations including exponential backoff and maximum attempt limits.
/// By default, the maximum retry count is 5 attempts, providing a balance between reliability and performance.
public final class TemporalClient: Sendable {
    /// The workflow service client that handles workflow operations and lifecycle management.

    // MARK: Connect

    /// Creates and manages a lifetime-scoped Temporal client that executes the provided closure.
    ///
    /// - Note: grpc-swiftâ€™s `ClientTransport` provides an option to configure an additional retry *throttling* policy via `ClientTransport/retryThrottle`, applicable to all retryable status codes.
    /// This throttling mechanism works in conjunction with the retry logic implemented in ``TemporalClient`` and can help reduce server load during periods of high request failure rates.
    ///
    /// The Temporal Rust SDK uses retry throttling specifically for the `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` status code, but the Swift implementation applies throttling uniformly across all retryable status codes.
    /// Note that users are not expected to configure a custom retry throttle in most cases, as the ``TemporalClient``already applies a conservative retry attempt count (max is 5), in contrast to the potentially unlimited retries in the Rust SDK.
    ///
    /// - Note: The tracing of the ``TemporalClient`` via ``TemporalClientTracingInterceptor`` is enabled by default, overwrite ``TemporalClient/Configuration-swift.struct/interceptors`` to disable.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - transport: The transport layer that should be used by the gRPC connection of the ``TemporalClient``.
    ///   - configuration: The configuration of the ``TemporalClient``.
    ///   - logger: The logger used in the ``TemporalClient``.
    ///   - body: A closure which is called with the ``TemporalClient``. When the closure returns, the ``TemporalClient`` is shutdown gracefully.
    /// - Returns: The result of the passed closure.
