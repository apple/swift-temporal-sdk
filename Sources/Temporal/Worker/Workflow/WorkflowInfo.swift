/// Information about a workflow execution.
///
/// This structure provides detailed metadata about the workflow execution including
/// identifiers, timing information, configuration, and parent workflow details.
/// The information is determined when the workflow is initialized and remains
/// consistent throughout the workflow's lifecycle.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Workflow info is accessed through the workflow context:
///
/// ```swift
/// func run(context: WorkflowContext, input: MyInput) async throws -> MyOutput {
///     let info = context.info
///     print("Workflow ID: \(info.workflowID)")
///     print("Attempt: \(info.attempt)")
///     print("Task Queue: \(info.taskQueue)")
/// }
/// ```

    /// or other retry-triggering conditions.

    ///
    /// This corresponds to the workflow's registration name and is used
    /// for workflow identification and routing.

    ///
    /// This ID remains constant across all attempts and retries of the same
    /// workflow execution instance.

    ///
    /// This typically corresponds to the Swift type name of the workflow
    /// definition unless explicitly overridden.

    /// The unique run identifier for the current workflow execution attempt.
    ///

    ///
    /// This timeout applies to individual workflow task executions.

    ///
    /// This timeout applies to the entire lifecycle of the workflow,
    /// including all retries. `nil` indicates no execution timeout is configured.
    public var executionTimeout: Duration?

    ///
    /// This value is `nil` for the initial execution attempt and contains
