/// A Temporal worker that processes activities and workflows for a specific namespace and task queue.
///
/// Use a Temporal worker to register activities and workflows, then process tasks from the Temporal server.
/// The worker polls for tasks, executes them, and reports results back to the server.
///
/// You can manage the worker's lifetime as a `swift-service-lifecycle` `Service` within a
/// `ServiceGroup` for structured concurrency and graceful shutdown handling.
///
/// ## Creating a Worker
///
/// Initialize a worker with configuration, transport, activities, workflows, and a logger:
///
/// ```swift
/// let temporalWorker = TemporalWorker(
///     configuration: .init(
///         namespace: "my-namespace",
///         taskQueue: "my-task-queue"
///     ),
///     transport: .http2NIOPosix(
///         target: .host("localhost", port: 7233),
///         transportSecurity: .plaintext
///     ),
///     activityContainers: MyActivityContainer(),
///     activities: [],
///     workflows: [MyWorkflow.self],
///     logger: logger
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Running the Worker
///
/// Start processing tasks by calling the `run()` method:
///
/// ```swift
/// try await temporalWorker.run()
/// ```
///
/// The worker runs indefinitely until cancelled or gracefully shut down.
///
/// ## Lifecycle Management
///
/// The worker supports graceful shutdown through the `Service` protocol. When shutdown is initiated,
/// the worker stops polling for new tasks, completes running tasks, and releases resources.
