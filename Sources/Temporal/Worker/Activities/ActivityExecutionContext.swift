/// and use it to send heartbeats and check cancellation status.

/// ## Accessing the Context
///
/// ```swift
/// struct MyActivity {
///     @Activity
///     func run(input: String) async throws -> String {
///         let context = ActivityExecutionContext.current!
///
///         // Send heartbeat during long-running work
///         context.heartbeat(details: "Processing step 1")
///
///         // Check for cancellation
///         if let reason = context.cancellationReason {
///             throw ActivityError.cancelled(reason)
///         }
///
///         return "Completed"
///     }
/// }
