# Order Fulfillment Example

This example demonstrates how to orchestrate multiple activities in a Temporal workflow to implement a realistic e-commerce order fulfillment process. It showcases Temporal's reliability, retry handling, and activity orchestration patterns using the Swift Temporal SDK.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Activity Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple external service calls in a reliable sequence
2. **Retry Policies**: Configuring appropriate retry strategies for different types of operations
3. **Error Handling**: Distinguishing between retryable and non-retryable errors
4. **Best Practices**: When to use activities vs. workflow code, and how to structure inputs/outputs
5. **Real-World Patterns**: Implementing a complete business process with external dependencies

## Business Process

The workflow implements a complete order fulfillment flow with six sequential steps:

```
1. Check Inventory    â†’ Verify all items are in stock
2. Process Payment    â†’ Charge customer via payment gateway
3. Reserve Inventory  â†’ Update stock levels in inventory system
4. Create Shipment    â†’ Generate tracking number from shipping provider
5. Send Confirmation  â†’ Notify customer via email/SMS
6. Update Order       â†’ Mark order as fulfilled in database
```

## Activities

Each activity represents a call to an external service, benefiting from Temporal's automatic retry and observability:

### `checkInventory`
- **Purpose**: Validates inventory availability with external inventory management system
- **Retry Strategy**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Error Handling**: Out-of-stock errors are non-retryable business errors

### `processPayment`
- **Purpose**: Charges customer through payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
- **Retry Strategy**: 5 attempts with longer timeouts to handle payment gateway delays
- **Error Handling**: `InsufficientFunds` and `InvalidCard` are non-retryable
- **Special Feature**: Demonstrates idempotent payment processing

### `reserveInventory`
- **Purpose**: Updates stock levels in inventory database after successful payment
- **Retry Strategy**: 3 attempts with quick retries for database operations

### `createShipment`
- **Purpose**: Creates shipment and returns tracking number from shipping provider API
- **Retry Strategy**: 4 attempts with moderate timeouts for external API calls

### `sendConfirmation`
- **Purpose**: Sends order confirmation to customer via notification service
- **Retry Strategy**: 3 attempts (notifications can be retried safely)

### `updateOrderStatus`
- **Purpose**: Updates order status in order management database
- **Retry Strategy**: 3 attempts with quick retries for database operations

## Retry Configuration

Each activity uses tailored retry policies. For example:

```swift
// Payment processing - longer timeouts, non-retryable business errors
retryPolicy: .init(
    initialInterval: .seconds(1),
    backoffCoefficient: 2.0,
    maximumInterval: .seconds(30),
    maximumAttempts: 5,
    nonRetryableErrorTypes: ["InsufficientFunds", "InvalidCard"]
)

// Database operations - quick retries, shorter timeouts
retryPolicy: .init(
    initialInterval: .milliseconds(500),
    backoffCoefficient: 2.0,
    maximumInterval: .seconds(10),
    maximumAttempts: 3
)
```

## Fake Services

The example includes realistic fake implementations of external services:

- **`FakeInventoryService`**: Simulates inventory management system with stock tracking
- **`FakePaymentService`**: Simulates payment gateway with idempotency handling
- **`FakeShippingService`**: Simulates shipping provider API with tracking numbers
- **`FakeNotificationService`**: Simulates email/SMS notification service
- **`FakeOrderDatabase`**: Simulates order management database

Each service includes realistic delays to simulate network calls.

## Running the Example

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a Temporal server running locally:
```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

### Execute the Workflow
```bash
swift run MultipleActivitiesExample
```

### Expected Output

```
ðŸ›’ Starting Order Fulfillment Workflow Example
============================================================

ðŸ“‹ Order Details:
  Order ID: ORD-DD22C618
  Customer: customer-123
  Items: laptop, mouse, keyboard
  Total: $1299.99

ðŸ“¦ Checking inventory for 3 item(s)...
âœ… All items in stock
ðŸ’³ Processing payment of $1299.99 for customer customer-123...
âœ… Payment successful: pay_AEF5A9AF-678
ðŸ“¦ Reserving inventory for order ORD-DD22C618...

ðŸ“¦ Order Status: fulfilled
ðŸ’³ Payment ID: pay_AEF5A9AF-678

```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Why Activities?
Each operation is an activity because it:
- Calls an external service (payment gateway, shipping API, database)
- Can fail transiently and needs retry logic
- Should be tracked and monitored independently
- Benefits from Temporal's reliability guarantees

### Why Not Workflow Code?
Operations like string concatenation or simple calculations should happen in workflow code, not activities. Activities are for operations with side effects or external dependencies.

### Structured Input/Output
All activity inputs and outputs use Codable structs rather than tuples:
```swift
struct PaymentInput: Codable {
    let customerId: String
    let amount: Double
}
```

This ensures proper serialization and makes the API clear and type-safe.

## Further Exploration

Try modifying this example to:
- Add parallel activity execution (check inventory and validate address simultaneously)
- Implement compensation/rollback (refund payment if shipment fails)
- Add a signal to cancel an order mid-fulfillment
- Use a query to check order status while workflow is running
