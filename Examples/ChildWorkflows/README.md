# Child Workflows - Pizza Restaurant

Demonstrates parent and child workflow orchestration through a pizza restaurant order fulfillment system.

## Features

**Child Workflow Patterns:**
- Parallel child workflows for multiple pizzas
- Parallel execution of sides with pizza preparation
- Sequential child workflow for delivery after cooking
- Custom workflow IDs for tracking
- Result aggregation from multiple children

**Workflows:**
- `PizzaOrderWorkflow` (parent) - Orchestrates complete order
- `MakePizzaWorkflow` (child) - Prepares individual pizzas
- `PrepareSidesWorkflow` (child) - Prepares sides
- `AssignDeliveryWorkflow` (child) - Handles delivery

## Usage

Start Temporal server:
```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

Run the example:
```bash
swift run ChildWorkflowExample
```

The example demonstrates:
1. Order with 3 pizzas and sides received
2. Pizza child workflows execute in parallel
3. Sides child workflow executes concurrently
4. Delivery child workflow executes sequentially
5. Results aggregated and returned

## Key Patterns

**Starting parallel child workflows with task groups:**
```swift
let results = try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: (Int, String).self) { group in
    for (index, pizzaSpec) in pizzas.enumerated() {
        group.addTask {
            let handle = try await Workflow.startChildWorkflow(
                MakePizzaWorkflow.self,
                options: .init(id: "order-\(orderID)-pizza-\(index + 1)"),
                input: pizzaSpec
            )
            return (index, try await handle.result())
        }
    }

    var results: [String] = Array(repeating: "", count: pizzas.count)
    for try await (index, result) in group {
        results[index] = result
    }
    return results
}
```

**Sequential child workflow execution:**
```swift
let deliveryHandle = try await Workflow.startChildWorkflow(
    AssignDeliveryWorkflow.self,
    options: .init(id: "\(orderId)-delivery"),
    input: deliveryInfo
)
let result = try await deliveryHandle.result()
```

**Using `executeChildWorkflow` convenience method:**
```swift
let result = try await Workflow.executeChildWorkflow(
    MakePizzaWorkflow.self,
    input: pizzaSpec
)
```

View workflows in Temporal UI: `http://localhost:8233`
- Parent workflow shows child workflow executions
- Each child appears as separate workflow
- Observe parallel execution timing
