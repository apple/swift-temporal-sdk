## 📖 Overview

The Temporal Swift SDK provides a package for building distributed, durable
workflows and activities using Swift's modern concurrency features. Temporal
enables you to build reliable applications that recover from failures, scale
dynamically, and maintain long-running business processes with confidence.

**Key Features:**
- 🔄 **Durable Workflows**: Build fault-tolerant workflows that survive
  infrastructure failures
- 🏗️ **Scalable Architecture**: Distribute workflow execution across multiple
  workers
- ⚡ **Swift Concurrency**: Native integration with Swift Structured Concurrency
- 🎯 **Type Safety**: Compile-time type checking for workflow and activity
  definitions
- 📊 **Observability**: Built-in support for logging, metrics and tracing
- 🔧 **Macro-based APIs**: Simple `@Workflow` and `@Activity` macros to avoid
  boilerplate
- 🧪 **Testing Support**: Easily test your workflows and activities

## ⚙️ Use Cases

The Temporal Swift SDK excels in scenarios requiring reliable, long-running
business processes such as:

**🛒 E-commerce & Payment Processing**
- Order fulfillment workflows with inventory, payment, and shipping coordination
- Multi-step payment processing with automatic retry and rollback capabilities
- Subscription billing and recurring payment management

**🔄 Data Processing & ETL**
- Large-scale data transformation pipelines with fault tolerance
- Event-driven data processing with guaranteed delivery
- Batch processing jobs with progress tracking and resumption

**🏢 Business Process Automation**
- Approval workflows with human-in-the-loop interactions
- Multi-system integration and orchestration
- Document processing and compliance workflows

**📊 Monitoring & Operations**
- Health check orchestration across distributed systems
- Automated incident response and remediation
- Scheduled maintenance and cleanup tasks

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Swift version: Swift 6.2+

To install/upgrade Swift, see https://www.swift.org/install/

### Adding as a dependency

To use the Swift Temporal SDK in your Swift project, add it as a dependency in
your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-temporal-sdk.git", upToNextMinor: "0.1.0")
]
```

### Running the project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com/apple/swift-temporal-sdk.git
   ```

2. **Build the package**
   ```bash
   swift build
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   swift test
   ```

4. **Run an example**
   ```bash
   # Install Temporal CLI from https://temporal.io/setup/install-temporal-cli
   temporal server start-dev
   cd Examples/Greeting
   swift run GreetingExample
   ```

### Usage

Here's a simple example showing how to create a workflow and activity:

```swift
import Temporal
import Logging

// Define an activity
@ActivityContainer
struct GreetingActivities {
    @Activity
    func sayHello(input: String) -> String {
        "Hello, \(input)!"
    }
}

// Define a workflow
@Workflow
final class GreetingWorkflow {
    func run(input: String) async throws -> String {
        let greeting = try await Workflow.executeActivity(
            GreetingActivities.Activities.sayHello.self,
            options: ActivityOptions(startToCloseTimeout: .seconds(30)),
            input: input
        )
        return greeting
    }
}

// Create worker and client
@main
struct MyApp {
    static func main() async throws {
        let worker = try TemporalWorker(
            configuration: .init(
                namespace: "default",
                taskQueue: "greeting-queue"
            ),
            target: .ipv4(address: "127.0.0.1", port: 7233),
            transportSecurity: .plaintext,
            activityContainers: GreetingActivities(),
            workflows: [GreetingWorkflow.self],
            logger: Logger(label: "worker")
        )
        
        let client = try TemporalClient(
            target: .ipv4(address: "127.0.0.1", port: 7233),
            transportSecurity: .plaintext,
            logger: Logger(label: "client")
        )
        
        // Execute workflow
        let result = try await client.executeWorkflow(
            GreetingWorkflow.self,
            options: .init(id: "greeting-1", taskQueue: "greeting-queue"),
            input: "World"
        )
        
        print(result) // "Hello, World!"
    }
}
```
